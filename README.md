# MshImportDL2New
This is a version that works much better than the older versions for Dying Light 2

Welcome to MshImportDL2

INSTRUCTIONS:

Rename the fixfile.txt to fixfile.fix
1. Have your common_meshes_pc.rpack and fixfile.fix and your .msh created from DL1 devtools in the same folder as MshImportDL2.exe
2. Run MshImportDL2
3. Follow the on-screen instructions

NOTES:

1. If you find your Dying Light 2 crashing, try giving it another file number when the on-screen prompt appears
2. The prompt should be flooded with "debug 'insert number here'", use this to locate where an error is if the program fails
3. The program does not support materials (as of yet)
